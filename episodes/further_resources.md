## Will I Ever Know it All?

![[xkcd : Git](https://xkcd.com/1597/)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)

Probably not. There is simply too much to [Git][git] and associated tools like [GitHub][gh]/[GitLab][gl] and
[Pre-Commit][precommit] to have any hope of knowing everything there is to about all aspects, and besides the tools,
just like programming languages,  evolve over time. That shouldn't dishearten you from learning what you need to as you
go.

## How can I keep on learning more about Git?

Practise makes perfect, or so the saying goes, but in the case of computing it really is true, if you don't practise
using the tools or writing code you will not improve. Whilst you might not reach perfection you will become more
proficient.

## What material would you recommend?

This course is the result of the author(s) learning path which was not undertaken in isolation but a consequence of
years of usage and a lot of reading.  Below there are links to a number of references, blogs, videos and so forth for
finding out more about Git, GitHub and so forth.

### References

- [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) a comprehensive book about Git, very, very detailed.
- [Learn Git - Tutorials, Workflows and Commands | Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git) excellent resources from
  Atlassian their tutorials are clear and informative and inspired much of this course.

### Videos

Former founder of GitHub and co-author of the excellent book [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) Scott Chacon is
big on Git advocacy. His book and articles are well worth reading and his videos are worth watching too.

- [So You Think You Know Git - Scott Chacon FOSDEM 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aolI_Rz0ZqY) an excellent talk
  by one of the co-founders of GitHub.
- [So You Think You Know Git (Part 2) - Scott Chacon DevWorld 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md44rcw13k4) another
  excellent talk.

These are summarised in the following series of blog posts.

- [Git Tips 1: Oldies but Goodies](https://blog.gitbutler.com/git-tips-1-theres-a-git-config-for-that/)
- [Git Tips 2: Some Subtle New Things](https://blog.gitbutler.com/git-tips-2-new-stuff-in-git/)
- [Git Tips 3: Really Large Repositories and
  Monorepos](https://blog.gitbutler.com/git-tips-3-really-large-repositories/)

### Blogs

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

## RSS

[Really Simply Syndication](https://rssboard.org/rss-specification) is a much under appreciated/used technology that
makes it really simple to syndicate blog posts from a range of sources to give yourself a customised reading list rather
than being at the whim of whatever is in your social media feeds when you happen to take a look at them.

Many of the blogs linked above have RSS feeds and whilst not all posts will be focused on Git you can sometimes get
specific feeds for topics. I would highly recommend using [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) reader not just for
improving your understanding of Git but all other research areas (e.g. Python, R, Open Research et.c) Some useful
resources for RSS feeds are below.

- [Get RSS Feed URL Extension](https://github.com/shevabam/get-rss-feed-url-extension) is a browser extension which digs
  out the RSS feed for a page.
- [OpenRSS](https://openrss.org/) is a simple way of creating RSS feeds for sites, even if they don't natively provided
  them.
- [Feeder](https://github.com/spacecowboy/Feeder) open source, private feed reader that runs on your Android device.
- [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) web-based feed aggregator.
- [FreshRSS](https://www.freshrss.org/) a free, self-hostable feeds aggregator if you run your own websites.
- [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/) another free, self-hostable feeds aggregator if you run your own websites.

### StackOverflow

You will likely have already come across [StackOverflow][so] already. Its a popular forum for asking and answering
questions about almost any aspect of computing (with many subject specific sub-forums in [StackExchange][se]). It is
worth creating an account here even if you never intend to ask questions as it is possible to bookmark questions and
answers for future reference. Bookmarks can be organised into lists to make it easier to find specific topics.

When searching use the `[<tag>]` notation to search for posts with specific tags, for example to search for posts tagged
with `git` you would include `[git]` in your search terms, for `github` you would include `[github]` and so on.

If you do ask questions try and provide as much information as possible in your question as to what you have tried (in
terms of code and/or commands), the _exact_ output (copy and paste) and format your post using Markdown to make it
easier for people to read.

Also consider creating a [minimal reproducible example][reprex] to demonstrate your problem to others so they can
recreate the problem, investigate where things have gone wrong and provide useful answers.

### Mastodon

There are a lot of technical users who post their articles, ask questions and help each other out about all sorts
of languages and tools on Mastodon. Join an instance and follow `#git` to keep abreast of things and find out what
others struggle with and how they can be solved.

[Fedi.Tips](https://fedi.tips/) is a useful guide to getting started with Mastodon and once you're setup it can be
useful to use the [Advanced Web
Interface](https://fedi.tips/how-to-activate-mastodons-tweetdeck-style-advanced-web-interface/) and add a column for the
`#git` tag. A good Android client is [Fedilab](https://fedilab.app/).
