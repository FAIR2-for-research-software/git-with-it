# Git Collaboration

Welcome to the _Git Collaboration_ course material.

This course aims to help you develop a deeper understanding of how Git works to facilitate collaboration. It builds on
foundational Git courses such as [Software Carpentry: Git Novice][swCarpentryGit] and [Git and GitHub through
GitKraken : From Zero to Hero!][zeroHero].

The core idea around which the course is based is to improve your understanding of working with branches and how to
make a clean Git history in terms of commits and pull requests which in turn makes it easier to collaborate and work on
code with others (including your future self!).

The course is split into six episodes. The first three introduce the concepts of branches and how to navigate them and
handle diverging branches and introduces the concept of atomic commits and keeping your commit history clean. The
remaining three chapters introduce the concept of Git along with the Pre-Commit framework and how these can be leveraged
in Continuous Integration.
